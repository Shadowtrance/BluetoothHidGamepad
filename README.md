# BluetoothHidGamepad
12 Button 2 Axis gamepad created with an Attiny2313 and an RN-42 bluetooth module or a converted HC-05 bluetooth module inspired by (and expanded on a little) https://mitxela.com/projects/bluetooth_hid_gamepad

Parts needed are an ATtiny2313, and RN-42 bluetooth module **OR** a HC-05 bluetooth module converted to an RN-42 as explained in the link above and obviously some buttons / joystick / wire and a way to program the chip.

**Set the low fuse to 0xE4 and write the hex to the chip, wire it up and you're done.**
